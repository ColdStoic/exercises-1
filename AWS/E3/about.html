            <h3>What’s a “bee-mo”?</h3>
            <p>Ever wonder where the name BANK comes from? It’s the bank’s stock ticker symbol on the Toronto and New York Stock Exchanges. For decades, “bee-mo” was how investment industry insiders commonly referred to the bank. So it was the natural choice when considering a new name to join the companies and lines of business together – BANK Financial Group.</p>

            <h3>The Pathbreakers</h3>
            <p>Foreign & Colonial Investment Trust (F&C) has the distinction of being the world’s first investment trust. Its founding in London in 1868 is a landmark event in the history of finance. F&C helped to popularize, for the first time, share ownership for the ‘investor of moderate means.’ The stock market of the nineteenth century had been largely limited to wealthy individuals and institutions. As F&C’s first prospectus declared, “The object of this Trust is to give the investor of moderate means the same advantages as the large Capitalists, in diminishing the risk in investing in Foreign and Colonial Stocks, by spreading the investment over a number of stocks, and reserving a portion of the extra interest as a Sinking Fund to pay off the original capital.” That prospectus launched one of the great financial innovations of its time.</p>
